Edited and remade a travel website i was making in free time as Make my Trip Website for my assignment in Front-End Web Dev for college, used w3schools, a website build from user ecpieritz on github, i just edited and switched around the code she actually had make spendidly, special thanks to favicons and material icons and the makers and contributors of bootstrap. Bootstrap was very interesting to experiment with and even easier to understand! - Amirthaz
